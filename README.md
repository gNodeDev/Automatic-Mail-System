1. Install Mongo DB as I have used the same. Make changes in server regarding DB and configuration changes, go to server->configuration->config.js

2. Start the server by using commands cd server first and then npm run server. 

3. Start client by using  cd client and ng serve --o. 

Please note that npm_modules have been removed, so please use npm install like this cd server npm install or cd client npm install.
